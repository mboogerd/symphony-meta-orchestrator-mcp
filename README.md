# Symphony Meta-Orchestrator MCP

This repository will host the MCP server that routes planning requests across
Linear-backed Symphony project runners.

Initial responsibilities:

- Maintain the project registry that maps Linear projects to repositories and
  Symphony runner configuration.
- Provide tools for creating and linking Linear issues.
- Provide tools for starting, stopping, and inspecting Symphony runner
  instances.
- Keep ticket creation separate from execution: planned work starts in backlog,
  and only ready work is moved into Symphony's active states.
